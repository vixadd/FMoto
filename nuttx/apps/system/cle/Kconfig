config SYSTEM_CLE_DEBUGLEVEL
	int "Debug level"
	default 0
	range 0 2
	---help---
		0=Debug off; 1=Print errors on console; 2=Print debug information
		on the console.

		Debug output is generated with syslog.  The editor works on
		/dev/console.  In order to get both a usable display and also
		readable debug output, syslog'ing should sent to some device other
		than /dev/console (which is the default).
