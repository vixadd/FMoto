APBridge application is the USB <=> UniPro glue.
The main role of application is to init UniPro, USB and the glue and perform
transfer between USB and UniPro.

This application can work without UniPro (disable CONFIG_APBRIDGEA_UNIPRO).
If UniPro is disabled, greybus-core is built and instead of transferring data
between USB and UniPro, data are passed directly to greybus-core.
This is useful for USB development (remove any issue related to UniPro) and for
protocol development. You can develop and test a new protocol using only one
bridge.
It's like gbsim but instead of running on Linux, it run in firmware.
