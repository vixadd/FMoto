	---help---
		Enable or disable support for packet sockets.

		Packet sockets allow receiving and transmitting frames without
		a transport protocol in between. Frames received are copied into
		a packet socket tap before they enter uIP. Data written into a
		packet socket will bypass uIP altogether and be placed in the
		transmission buffer of the network interface driver.
