	default n
	depends on !BINFMT_DISABLE
	---help---
		Enable support for the exec[l|v] family of functions that can be
		used to start other programs, terminating the current program and
		the posix_spawn() familty of functions that can be used start other
		programs without terminating the current program.  The typical
		usage of the exec[l|v] functions is (1) first call vfork() to create
		a new thread, then (2) call exec[l|v] to replace the new thread with
		a program from the file system.

		NOTE 1: This two step process start is completely unnecessary in
		NuttX and is provided only for compatibily with Unix systems.  These
		functions are essentially just wrapper functions that (1) call the
		non-standard binfmt function 'exec', and then (2) exit(0).  Since
		the new thread will be terminated by the exec[l|v] call, it really
		served no purpose other than to suport Unix compatility.

		The posix_spawn() functions do not have this inefficiency.

		NOTE 2: Support for exec[l|v] and posix_spawn() is conditional
		because they require additional support for symbol tables that
		will not be available in the typical system.

	default n if BUILD_KERNEL
	default y if !BUILD_KERNEL

config EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB
	string "Symbol table used by exec[l|v]"
	default "g_symtab"
	---help---
		The exec[l|v] and posix_spawn() functions are wrapper functions that
		call the non-standard binfmt function 'exec').  The binfmt
		function 'exec' needs to have (1) a symbol table that provides the
		list of symbols exported by the base code, and (2) the number of
		symbols in that table.  This selection provides the name of that
		symbol table.

config POSIX_SPAWN_PROXY_STACKSIZE
	int "Spawn Stack Size"
	default 1024
	---help---
		If posix_spawn[p]() and task_spawn() use I/O redirection options,
		they will require an intermediary/proxy task to muck with the file
		descriptors.  This configuration item specifies the stack size
		used for the proxy. Default: 1024 bytes.

config TASK_SPAWN_DEFAULT_STACKSIZE
	int "Default task_spawn Stack Size"
	default 2048
	depends on !ARCH_ADDRENV
	---help---
		The actual size to use for the child task's stack can be set with
		task_spawnattr_setstacksize().  This value specifies the default
		stack size to use if task_spawnattr_setstacksize() is not used.
		Default: 2048.

config LIBC_STRERROR
	bool "Enable strerror"
	default n
	---help---
		strerror() is useful because it decodes 'errno' values into a human readable
		strings.  But it can also require a lot of memory.  If this option is selected,
		strerror() will still exist in the build but it will not decode error values.
		This option should be used by other logic to decide if it should use strerror()
		or not.  For example, the NSH application will not use strerror() if this
		option is not selected; perror() will not use strerror() is this option is not
		selected (see also NSH_STRERROR).

config LIBC_STRERROR_SHORT
	bool "Use short error descriptions in strerror()"
	default n
	depends on LIBC_STRERROR
	---help---
		If this option is selected, then strerror() will use a shortened string when
		it decodes the error.  Specifically, strerror() is simply use the string that
		is the common name for the error.  For example, the 'errno' value of 2 will
		produce the string "No such file or directory" is LIBC_STRERROR_SHORT
		is not defined but the string "ENOENT" is LIBC_STRERROR_SHORT is defined.

config LIBC_PERROR_STDOUT
	bool "perror() to stdout"
	default n
	---help---
		POSIX requires that perror() provide its output on stderr.  This option may
		be defined, however, to provide perror() output that is serialized with
		other stdout messages.

config LIB_SENDFILE_BUFSIZE
	int "sendfile() buffer size"
	default 512
	---help---
		Size of the I/O buffer to allocate in sendfile().  Default: 512b

config ARCH_ROMGETC
	bool "Support for ROM string access"
	default n
	---help---
		In Harvard architectures, data accesses and instruction accesses
		occur on different buses, perhaps concurrently.  All data accesses
		are performed on the data bus unless special machine instructions
		are used to read data from the instruction address space.  Also, in
		the typical MCU, the available SRAM data memory is much smaller that
		the non-volatile FLASH instruction memory.  So if the application
		requires many constant strings, the only practical solution may be
		to store those constant strings in FLASH memory where they can only
		be accessed using architecture-specific machine instructions.

		If ARCH_ROMGETC is defined, then the architecture logic must export
		the function up_romgetc().  up_romgetc() will simply read one byte
		of data from the instruction space.

		If ARCH_ROMGETC is selected, certain C stdio functions are effected: (1)
		All format strings in printf, fprintf, sprintf, etc. are assumed to lie
		in FLASH (string arguments for %s are still assumed to reside in SRAM).
		And (2), the string argument to puts and fputs is assumed to reside
		in FLASH.  Clearly, these assumptions may have to modified for the
		particular needs of your environment.  There is no "one-size-fits-all"
		solution for this problem.

config ARCH_OPTIMIZED_FUNCTIONS
	bool "Enable arch optimized functions"

		Use pre-increment of pointers. Default is post increment of pointers.

config MEMCPY_INDEXED_COPY
	bool "Array indexing"
	default y

		Copying data using array indexing. Using this option, disables the
		MEMCPY_PRE_INC_PTRS option.

	bool "Enable worker thread"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_SIGNALS
	---help---
		Create a dedicated "worker" thread to handle delayed processing from interrupt
		handlers.  This feature is required for some drivers but, if there are no
		complaints, can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
		garbage collection -- completing any delayed memory deallocations from
		interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled, then that clean up will
		be performed by the IDLE thread instead (which runs at the lowest of priority
		and may not be appropriate if memory reclamation is of high priority).

		In NuttX, a keyboard/keypad driver is simply a character driver that
		may have an (optional) encoding/decoding layer on the data returned
		by the character driver. A keyboard may return simple text data
		(alphabetic, numeric, and punctuaction) or control characters
		(enter, control-C, etc.).  However, in addition, most keyboards
		support actions that cannot be represented as text data. Such
		actions include things like cursor controls (home, up arrow,
		page down, etc.), editing functions (insert, delete, etc.), volume
		controls, (mute, volume up, etc.) and other special functions.
		Some special encoding may be required to multiplex these two classes
		of data.

		This option enables the functions that implement the encoding and
		decoding of keyboard data.  These are the interfaces prototyped in
