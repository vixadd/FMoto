  NuttX is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).

  <td>
    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

      Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit).

      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX
  source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising
  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function.
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <b>Other Tricks</b>

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttXConfigVariables.html">Configuration Variable Documentation</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

            This port was extended in NuttX 5.3 with a USB high speed driver contributed by David Hewson.
            David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.

            It is similar to the EA3131 port except:  (1) I have not yet gotten the SDRAM to work, and (2) this board was used to develop and verify the USB 2.0, low-/full-/high-speed EHCI host controller driver.
            NOTE: That driver should work on the EA3131 as well.  However, the EA3131 uses a PCA9532 PWM part to controller the port power so the it would not quite be a simple drop-in.

          <b>STATUS</b>.
          Initial support for the SAMA5D3x-EK was released in NuttX-6.29.
          That initial support was minimal:
          There are simple test configurations that run out of internal SRAM and extended configurations that run out of the on-board NOR FLASH:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A barebones NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that can be used as the basis for further application development.
          </li>
          <li>
            A full-loaded NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that demonstrates all of the SAMA5D3x features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following support was added in Nuttx 6.30:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            DMA support, and
          </li>
          <li>
            PIO interrupts,
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And drivers for
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SPI (with DMA support),
          </li>
          <li>
            AT25 Serial Flash,
          </li>
          <li>
            Two Wire Interface (TWI), and
          </li>
          <li>
            HSMCI memory cards.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NuttX-6.30 also introduces full USB support:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            High speed device controller driver,
          </li>
          <li>
            OHCI (low- and full-speed) and
          </li>
          <li>
            EHCI (high-speed) host controller driver support.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With NuttX-6.31, these additional drivers were added:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A 10/100Base-T Ethernet (EMAC) driver,
          </li>
          <li>
            A 1000Base-T Ethernet (GMAC) driver,
          </li>
          <li>
            A Real Time Clock (RTC) driver and integrated with the NuttX system time logic
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>/dev/random</code> using the SAMA5D3x True Random Number Generator (TRNG),
          </li>
          <li>
            A Watchdog Timer (WDT) driver,
          </li>
          <li>
            A Timer/Counter (TC) library with interface that make be used by other drivers that need timer support,
          </li>
          <li>
            An ADC driver that can collect multiple samples using the sequencer, can be trigger by a timer/counter, and supports DMA data transfers,
          </li>
          <li>
            A touchscreen driver based on the special features of the SAMA5D3 ADC peripheral,
            An LCD controller (LCDC) frame buffer driver, and
          </li>
          <li>
            A CAN driver (Testing of the CAN has been delayed because of cabling issues).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additional board configurations were added to test and demonstrate these new drivers including new graphics and NxWM configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These drivers were added in NuttX-6.32:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A PWM driver with DMA support
          </li>
          <li>
            An SSC-based I2S driver
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for Programmable clock outputs
          </li>
          <li>
            NAND support including support for the PMECC hardware ECC and for DMA transfers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          DBGU support was added in NuttX-7.2 (primarily for the SAMA5D3 Xplained board).
        </p>
        <p>
          NuttX-7.4 added support for the on-board WM8904 CODEC chip and for <i>Tickless</i> operation.

          <b>Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained development board</b>
          This is the  port of NuttX to the Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained development board.
          The board features the Atmel SAMA5D36 microprocessor.
          See the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d36.aspx">Atmel Website</a> for additional information about this board.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STATUS</b>.
          This port is complete as of this writing and ready for general use.
          The basic port is expected to be simple because of the similarity to the SAMAD3<i>x</i>-EK boards and is available in the NuttX 7.2 release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the drivers and capabilities of the SAMA5D3x-EK boards can be used with the SAMA5D3 Xplained board.
          The primary difference between the ports is that the SAMA5D3x-EK supports NOR FLASH and NuttX can be configured to boot directly from NOR FLASH.
          The SAMA5D3 Xplained board does not have NOR FLASH and, as a consequence NuttX must boot into SDRAM with the help of U-Boot.
        </p>

      There is a port in progress on one Atmel SAMA5D4 board:
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Atmel SAMA5D4-EK/MB development boards</b>
        This is the  port of NuttX to the Atmel SAMA5D4-MB Rev C. development board (which should be compatible with the SAMA5D4-EK).
        These boards feature the Atmel SAMA5D44 microprocessors with compatibility with most of the SAMA5D3 peripherals.
      </p>
      <p><b>STATUS</b>.
        At the time of the release of NuttX-7.3, the basic port for the SAMA5D4-MB was complete.
        The board had basic functionality.
        But full functionality was not available until NuttX-7.4.
        In NuttX-7.4 support was added for the L2 cache, many security features, XDMAC, HSMCI and Ethernet integrated with XDMAC, the LCDC, TWI, SSC, and most of the existing SAMA5 drivers.
        Timers were added to support <i>Tickless</i> operation.
        The TM7000 LCDC with the maXTouch multi-touch controller are also fully support in a special NxWM configuration for that larger display.
        Support for a graphics media player is included (although there were issues with the WM8904 audio CODEC on my board).
        An SRAM bootloader was also included.
        Refer to the NuttX board <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/nuttx/git/ci/master/tree/nuttx/configs/sama5d4-ek/README.txt">README</a> file for current status.

        <b>STATUS</b>.
        Initial support for the NUC120 was released in NuttX-6.26.
        This initial support is very minimal:
        There is a NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that might be the basis for an application development.
        As of this writing, more device drivers are needed to make this a more complete port.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the NUC120 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The NUC120LE2AN comes in a 48-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
        When running the NSH configuration (itself a full up application), there is still more than 90KB of FLASH and 10KB or SRAM available for further application development).
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  35037     106    1092   36235    8d8b nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 34.2KB of FLASH leaving 93.8KB of FLASH (72%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.26
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest

      <a name="stm32l152"><b>STMicro STM32L152 (STM32L &quot;EnergyLite&quot; Line)</b>.</a>
      This is a port of NuttX to the STMicro STM32L-Discovery development board.
      The STM32L-Discovery board is based on the STM32L152RBT6 MCU (128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        The STM32L-Discovery and 32L152CDISCOVERY kits are functionally equivalent.
        The difference is the internal Flash memory size (STM32L152RBT6 with 128 Kbytes or STM32L152RCT6 with 256 Kbytes).
        Both boards feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface,</li>
        <li>LCD (24 segments, 4 commons),</li>
        <li>LEDs,</li>
        <li>Pushbuttons,</li>
        <li>A linear touch sensor, and</li>
        <li>Four touchkeys.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS</b>.
        Initial support for the STM32L-Discovery was released in NuttX-6.28.
        This initial support includes a configuration using the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) that might be the basis for an application development.
        A driver for the on-board segment LCD is included as well as an option to drive the segment LCD from an NSH &quot;built-in&quot; command.
        As of this writing, a few more things are needed to make this a more complete port:  1) Verfication of more device drivers (timers, quadrature encoders, PWM, etc.), and 2) logic that actually uses the low-power consumption modes of the EnergyLite part.
        Refer to the NuttX board <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/nuttx/git/ci/master/tree/nuttx/configs/stm32ldiscovery/README.txt">README</a> file for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the STM32L152RBT6 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The STM32L152RBT6 comes in a 64-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  39664     132    1124   40920    9fd8 nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 38.7KB of FLASH leaving 89.3B of FLASH (70%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
      </p>
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.27
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         14096       3928      10168      10168
nsh>
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 9.9KB (62%) of SRAM heap is staill available for further application development while NSH is running.

      The port of NuttX to the WaveShare Open1788 is a collaborative effort between Rommel Marcelo and myself
      (with Rommel being the leading contributor and I claiming only a support role).
      You can get more information at the Open1788 board from the WaveShare <a href="http://www.wvshare.com/product/Open1788-Standard.htm">website</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      Initial Open1788 support appeared in NuttX-6.26 with the first verified configurations in NuttX-6.27.
      In NuttX-6.27 there is a working basic port with OS verification, Nuttshell (<a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configurations, and a graphics test configuration.
      SDRAM and GPDMA are working.
      The NSH configuration includes verfied support for a DMA-based SD card interface.
      The frame-buffer LCD driver is functional and uses the SDRAM for frame-buffer memory.
      A touchscreen interface has been developed but there appears to be a hardware issue with the WaveShare implementation of the XPT2046 touchscreen controller.

      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.20</b>
          The basic port is complete.
          The basic NuttShell (NSH) configuration is present and fully verified.
          This includes verified support for:  SYSTICK system time, pin and GPIO configuration, and a serial console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
              The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
              It should be possible to complete porting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.

        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has 256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM.
        Below is the current memory usage for the NSH configuration (June 9, 2013).
        This is <i>not</i> a minimal implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  43572     122    2380   46074    b3fa nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (&lt;7%) and leaves 29.7KB (92.7%) available for heap at runtime.
      </p>
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command.
        This runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage <i>plus</i> all dynamic memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.28
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         29232       5920      23312      23312
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is staill available for further application development while NSH is running.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).
      </li>

         This port is has completed all basic development, but there is more that needs to be done.
         All code is complete for the basic NuttX port including header files for all AT32UC3* peripherals.
         The untested AVR32 code was present in the 5.12 release of NuttX.
         Since then, the basic RTOS port has solidified:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The port successfully passes the NuttX OS test (apps/examples/ostest).
        </li>
        <li>
          A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
          Testing of that configuration has been postponed (because it got bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port).
          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The basic, port was be released in NuttX-5.13.

        This port is available as of release 0.3.18 of NuttX.  The port is basically complete
        and many examples run correctly.  However, there are remaining instabilities that
        make the port un-usable.  The nature of these is not understood; the behavior is
        that certain SH-1 instructions stop working as advertised.  This could be a silicon
        problem, some pipeline issue that is not handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain
        (which has very limit SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the CMON debugger.
        At any rate, I have exhausted all of the energy that I am willing to put into this cool
        old processor for the time being.

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, the following Windows native toolchains are in use:
      <ol>
        <li>GCC built for Windows (such as CodeSourcery, Atollic, devkitARM, etc.),</li>
        <li>SDCC built for Windows,</li>

      <li>
        <b>GNUWin32</b>.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make GIT snapshot of NuttX buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:

        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MSYS</b>.
      I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the above Cygwin environments.
      This is not surprising since MSYS is based on an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3).
      MSYS has been modified, however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin and that may be of value to some users.
    </p>
    <p>
      MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the <code>CMD.exe</code> shell.
      Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build envionment.
