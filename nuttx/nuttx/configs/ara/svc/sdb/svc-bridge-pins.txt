This file documents non-UniPro signals between the SVC and the bridge
ASICs on the SDB.

Below, "XXX" is APB1, APB2, APB3, GPB1, or GPB2.

SVC_DETECT_XXX: The purpose of these lines is to emulate
                hotplug events for the SVC firmware.

                The SVC "detects" or does "not detect" XXX
                depending on the state of line, and can be
                interrupted when it changes.

                They are connected to:

                   1. Pull-up resistor
                   2. Switch which can pull down to GND
                   3. SVC I/O expander (U701)

XXX_DETECT_IN: The purpose of these lines lines is to
               emulate hotplug events for the bridge
               ASICs.

               XXX "detects" or does "not detect" the SVC
               depending on the state of the line, and can
               be interrupted when it changes.

               They are connected to:

                   1. Switch to ground
                   2. XXX labeled debug header
                   3. XXX GPIO

SVC_WAKE_XXX: The purpose of these lines is to allow an out
              of band (from UniPro) means for the SVC to
              take XXX out of a "low-power" state when the
              UniPro link is powered down.

              The SVC "asserts" WAKE to XXX by changing this
              line's state to HIGH; XXX can be interrupted
              when it changes.

              They are connected to:

                   1. SVC GPIO
                   2. XXX GPIO

XXX_WAKE_SVC: The purpose of these lines is to allow an out
              of band (from UniPro) means for XXX to take
              the SVC out of a low-power state.

              XXX "asserts" WAKE to the SVC by changing this
              line's state to HIGH; the SVC can be
              interrupted by the I/O expander when it
              changes.

              They are connected to:

                   1. Pull-down resistor
                   2. SVC I/O expander
                   3. XXX GPIO

XXX_BOOTRET: The purpose of these lines is to allow the SVC to control
             the boot sequence of XXX.

             They are connected to:

                   1. SVC GPIO
                   2. XXX BOOTRET pin (cf. bridge ASIC manual)
                   3. XXX labeled debug header

XXX_PWROFF_N: The purpose of these pins is to control external power
              switches.

              They are connected to:

                   1. XXX labeled debug header
                   2. XXX PWROFF_N pin (cf. bridge ASIC manual)
