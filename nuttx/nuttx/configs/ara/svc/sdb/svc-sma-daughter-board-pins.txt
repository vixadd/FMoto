This file documents non-UniPro signals on the SDB meant for
use between the SVC and a daughter board containing a bridge
ASIC, which connects to the UniPro switch via SMA
connectors.

Below, "SMAy" is SMA1 or SMA2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SMA1_UART_TX,
SMA1_UART_RX: The purpose of these lines is to allow
              connecting an external UART on SMAy to the SDB
              8-UART USB connector.

              NOTE: these are only available for SMA1.

The above lines are connected to:

    1. Labeled header (J402)
    2. (Through a level shifter) FTDI quad UART
    3. Test points

---------------------------------------------------------------------

SVC_WAKE_SMAy: The purpose of these lines is to allow an out
               of band (from UniPro) means for the SVC to
               take SMAy out of a low-power state when the
               UniPro link (on the SMA ports) is powered
               down.

               The SVC "asserts" WAKE to SMAy by changing
               this line's state to HIGH.

SMAy_DET_IN: The purpose of these lines lines is to emulate
             hotplug events for SMAy.

             SMAy "detects" or does "not detect" the SVC
             depending on the state of the line.

SVC_RST_SMAy: The purpose of these lines is to allow the SVC
              to reset SMAy.

SMAy_BOOTRET: The purpose of these lines is to allow the SVC
              to control the boot sequence of SMAy.

SMAy_1P1_EN: The purpose of these lines is to control a 1.1V
             power rail on SMAy.

The above lines are connected to:

    1. Labeled header (SMA1: J402, SMA2: J403)
    2. SVC GPIOs

Additionally, SMAy_DET_IN lines are connected to:

    3. SVC I/O expander

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SMAy_WAKE_SVC: The purpose of these lines is to allow an out
               of band (from UniPro) means for the SVC to
               take SMAy out of a low-power state when the
               UniPro link is powered down.

The above lines are connected to:

    1. Labeled header (SMA1: J402, SMA2: J403)
    2. Pull-down resistor
    3. SVC I/O expander

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SMAy_1P2_EN: The purpose of these lines is to control a 1.2V
             power rail on SMAy.

SMAy_1P8_EN: The purpose of these lines is to enable 1.2V
             and 1.8V power rails on a daughter board.

They above lines are connected to:

    1. Labeled header (SMA1: J401, SMA2: J404)
    2. SVC GPIOs
