  /* If CONFIG_ARCH_LOWVECTORS is defined, then the vectors located at the
   * beginning of the .text region must appear at address at the address
   * specified in the VBAR.  There are three ways to accomplish this:
   *
   *   1. By explicitly mapping the beginning of .text region with a page
   *      table entry so that the virtual address zero maps to the beginning
   *      of the .text region.  VBAR == 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *   2. A second way is to map the use the AXI MATRIX remap register to
   *      map physical address zero to the beginning of the text region,
   *      either internal SRAM or EBI CS 0.  Then we can set an identity
   *      mapping to map the boot region at 0x0000:0000 to virtual address
   *      0x0000:00000.   VBAR == 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *      This method is used when booting from ISRAM or NOR FLASH.  In
   &      that case, vectors must lie at the beginning of NOFR FLASH.
   *
   *   3. Set the Cortex-A5 VBAR register so that the vector table address
   *      is moved to a location other than 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *      This is the method used when booting from SDRAM.
   *
   * - When executing from NOR FLASH, the first level bootloader is supposed
   *   to provide the AXI MATRIX mapping for us at boot time base on the state
   *   of the BMS pin.  However, I have found that in the test environments
   *   that I use, I cannot always be assured of that physical address mapping.
   *
   *   So we do both here.  If we are executing from NOR FLASH, then we provide
   *   the MMU to map the physical address of FLASH to address 0x0000:0000;
   *
   * - If we are executing out of ISRAM, then the SAMA5 primary bootloader
   *   probably copied us into ISRAM and set the AXI REMAP bit for us.
   *
   * - If we are executing from external SDRAM, then a secondary bootloader must
   *   have loaded us into SDRAM.  In this case, simply set the VBAR register
   *   to the address of the vector table (not necessary at the beginning
   *   or SDRAM).

 *   action of the SAMA5 "first level bootloader;"  it might be executing in
 *   CS1-3 through the action of some second level bootloader that provides

 *
 *   The system always boots from the ROM memory at address 0x0000:0000,
 *   starting the internal first level bootloader.  That bootloader can be
 *   configured to work in different ways using the BMS pin and the contents
 *   of the Boot Sequence Configuration Register (BSC_CR).
 *
 *   If the BMS_BIT is read "1", then the first level bootloader will
 *   support execution of code in the memory connected to CS0 on the EBI
 *   interface (presumably NOR flash).  The following sequence is performed
 *   by the first level bootloader if BMS_BIT is "1":
 *
 *     - The main clock is the on-chip 12 MHz RC oscillator,
 *     - The Static Memory Controller is configured with timing allowing
 *       code execution in CS0 external memory at 12 MHz
 *     - AXI matrix is configured to remap EBI CS0 address at 0x0
 *     - 0x0000:0000 is loaded in the Program Counter register
 *
 *   The user software in the external memory must perform the next
 *   operation in order to complete the clocks and SMC timings configuration
 *   to run at a higher clock frequency:
 *
 *     - Enable the 32768 Hz oscillator if best accuracy is needed
 *     - Reprogram the SMC setup, cycle, hold, mode timing registers for EBI
 *       CS0, to adapt them to the new clock.
 *     - Program the PMC (Main Oscillator Enable or Bypass mode)
 *     - Program and Start the PLL
 *     - Switch the system clock to the new value
 *
 *  If the BMS_BIT is read "0", then the first level bootloader will
 *  perform:
 *
 *     - Basic chip initialization: XTal or external clock frequency
 *       detection:
 *
 *       a. Stack Setup for ARM supervisor mode
 *       b. Main Oscillator Detection:  The bootloader attempts to use an
 *          external crystal.  If this is not successful, then  the 12 MHz
 *          Fast RC internal oscillator is used as the main osciallator.
 *       c. Main Clock Selection: The Master Clock source is switched from
 *          to the main oscillator without prescaler. PCK and MCK are now
 *          the Main Clock.
 *       d. PLLA Initialization: PLLA is configured to get a PCK at 96 MHz
 *          and an MCK at 48 MHz. If an external clock or crystal frequency
 *          running at 12 MHz is found, then the PLLA is configured to allow
 *          USB communication.
 *
 *     - Attempt to retrieve a valid code from external non-volatile
 *       memories (NVM): SPI0 CS0 Flash Boot, SD Card Boot, NAND Flash Boot,

 *       used with each media type.  If a valid image is found, it is copied
 *       to internal SRAM and started.
 *
 *     - In case no valid application has been found on any NVM, the SAM-BA
