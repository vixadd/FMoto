 * Name: up_idle
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_idle() is the logic that will be executed when their is no other
 *   ready-to-run task.  This is processor idle time and will continue until
 *   some interrupt occurs to cause a context switch from the idle task.
 *
 *   Processing in this state may be processor-specific. e.g., this is where
 *   power management operations might be performed.
 *

  /* We theorize that instruction fetch on the bridge silicon may stall an
   * in-progress USB DMA transfer.  The ideal solution is to halt the processor
   * during idle via WFI (wait for interrupt), but that degrades the JTAG
   * debugging experience (see discussion below).
   *
   * For debug builds, we'll try a work-around suggested by Olin Siebert, namely
   * to execute a sequence of 16-bit nop instructions.  The theory is that the CM3
   * core will fetch two 16-bit instructions at a time, but execute them
   * sequentially, dropping instruction fetch bandwidth by 50% during idle
   * periods, and offering USB DMA transfers the opportunity to progress and
   * complete.

   *
   * The JTAG interface is disabled during WFI, and WFI transitions may result in
   * unexpected traps when a JTAG debugger is connected.  A potential
   * work-around is to use the SWD interface lines instead of JTAG, e.g. by
   * supplying the "-if SWD" argument to JLinkGDBServer when using SEGGER products.
   * This appears to increase stability based on limited experimentation, but may
   * not be a panacea.  As such, we use the CONFIG_DEBUG option to select between
   * two approaches to resolving SW-425, with the hueristic that CONFIG_DEBUG
   * being enabled indicates a debug rather than production environment.
