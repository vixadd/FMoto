# MDK Utility
The MDK Utility application provides two separate functionalities.

First, it supports Moto Mods development, providing status information and the ability to flash your firmware on your Reference Moto Mod.  More details can be found at <http://developer.motorola.com/build/examples/mdk-utility>.

Additionally, it provides the basic "Hello World!" example of how an application communicates with the Moto Mods Development Kit via the Raw protocol.  More details can be found at <http://developer.motorola.com/build/examples/hello-world>.

For this project to be functional, you will need to download the latest Moto Mods SDK.  See <http://developer.motorola.com/build/tools/setup-environment> for the library and instructions.
