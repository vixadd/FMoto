## Introduction
The world of smart phones has come a long way in recent years. Not only in the advancement of the software that allows us to use it, but in the hardware that makes it function. As far as hardware goes, there is a vast array of innovative, and research opportunities in the world of hardware development. One such development is the synthesis of hardware modifications, and extensions. In the current market there is a common dynamic that happens with how external devices are used in systems. Usually they connect through some form of wired or wireless connection. From a user experience standpoint, this is not easy to use. Consumers desire ease of use. Attachments for phones that add functionality to a phone through the hardware itself is the solution to this problem.

The project for this capstone involves an example of hardware extensions which can be used to transmit FM Radio frequencies out from the phone. FM Transmitters on the market currently have bluetooth connections with their phones. The purpose of this project is to cut out the bluetooth or wired portion, and show the potential of hardware extensions in smartphones. The potential of this project is to demonstrate the hardware extension’s capabilities, as well as its future potential. Appliances used in everyday households can be operated with central devices. Tracking, and operating Cars, Computers, and Dishwashers with a smartphone no longer becomes something wireless, but a simple attachment that connects to your phone through hardware. Hardware interfacing holds many applications. Applications that fall under the categories of entertainment, appliances, and home automation. In the Internet of Things age, it is crucial to come up with new ways to interface with hardware that connects us to the rest of the world. With a new perspective on hardware interfacing, comes new innovations in the market of consumer electronics.

As this potential market is only just starting to bud, it is vital that we as engineers look at it’s capabilities technologically, as well as economically. The usage of this technology, spanning through several applications allows for a broad market. The system of these extensions being predicated on ease of use, and their ability to be used in hardware that connects people in different Internet of Things applications. If this type of system is feasible in all respects, then promulgating the idea of hardware extensions for mobile devices of everyday use will be a profitable venture. Not just for engineers, but for consumers as well.
